# processing-arduino

Arduino library for [processing](http://processing.org/).

I've taken [this code](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/Processing) and upgraded it to the newest version of Arduino.

## Install

1. Download/clone the code, rename the entire folder to Arduino, and put it in `~/Documents/Processing/libraries/`.
2. Run Arduino, open the Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata sketch, and upload it to the Arduino board.
3. In Processing, open one of the examples that comes with with the Arduino library and run it.
